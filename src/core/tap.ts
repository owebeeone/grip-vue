/**
 * GRIP Tap System - Data producers for reactive dataflow
 *
 * Taps are data producers that provide one or more Grips to the GRIP system.
 * They represent the source end of the data pipeline, generating values that
 * flow to consumer Drips through the GROK orchestration engine.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Taps advertise which Grips they can provide
 * - Taps can declare parameter dependencies for dynamic behavior
 * - Taps have lifecycle hooks for connection management
 * - Taps can be factories for lazy instantiation
 * - Taps support both single and multi-output scenarios

 *
 * Taps are the source end of the GRIP data pipeline. They generate values

 *
 * Taps can declare parameter dependencies that influence their behavior:
 * - Destination parameters: Read from the destination context lineage
 * - Home parameters: Read from the provider's home context lineage
 *
 * The engine manages the lifecycle of Taps, calling appropriate hooks
